Fork of https://github.com/ArcaEge/traffic

A template site for a mysterious Hack Club YSWS event, I'll be reusing the same site design but with different content.

<!-- The site is available at: https://traffic.arcaege.dev/ -->

Built with SvelteKit, deployed on Cloudflare Workers (because free!!! would highly recommend for small projects like this)

## Developing

I wouldn't recommend using anything other than npm as yarn didn't build on Cloudflare Workers for some reason.

Instructions generated by Svelte project generator:

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```
